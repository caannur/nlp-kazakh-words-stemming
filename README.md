# Kazakh-Russian Sentiment Analyzer  
### Multilingual NLP for Sentiment Analysis  

This project is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) system** for **sentiment analysis** on a **Kazakh-Russian dataset**. It focuses on **text preprocessing, classification, and model evaluation**, handling key challenges such as **lemmatization and stopword removal** to improve sentiment classification performance.  

---

## Features  

- **Multilingual Support** – Processes both **Kazakh** and **Russian** text  
- **Sentiment Classification** – Identifies **positive** and **negative** sentiment  
- **Text Preprocessing** – Implements **lemmatization, stopword removal, and tokenization**  
- **Machine Learning Model** – Uses **Logistic Regression** for classification  
- **Real-World Applications** – Applicable for **customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and opinion mining**  

---

## Dataset  

The dataset consists of **Kazakh and Russian** text labeled with sentiment values:  

- **1** → Positive sentiment  
- **0** → Negative sentiment  

Example dataset format:  

| ID  | Text | Sentiment |
|----|------|----------|
| 1  | "Бұл өнім өте жақсы!" | 1 |
| 2  | "Очень плохой сервис!" | 0 |

---

## Preprocessing Steps  

1. **Language Detection** – Identifies whether the text is in Kazakh or Russian  
2. **Tokenization** – Splits text into individual words  
3. **Stopword Removal** – Removes common words (e.g., "мен", "бұл", "и", "на")  
4. **Lemmatization** – Converts words to their base forms (**pymorphy2** for Russian)  
5. **Feature Extraction** – Uses **TF-IDF** to convert text into numerical representations  
6. **Model Training** – Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier for sentiment analysis

## Installation & Setup  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Kazakh-Russian-Sentiment-Analyzer.git
   cd Kazakh-Russian-Sentiment-Analyzer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the sentiment analyzer:  
   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

## Model & Techniques  

The project utilizes multiple models for sentiment classification:  

- **Logistic Regression** – A widely used baseline for text classification  
- **Naïve Bayes** – A probabilistic model for sentiment classification  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** – A deep learning approach for sequential text analysis  
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** – Captures contextual meaning more effectively  

---

## Results & Performance  

- **Model Accuracy**: **78%** on test data  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: **Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**  

---

## Future Improvements  

- **Deep Learning Models** – Implementing **BERT or GPT** for more advanced sentiment classification  
- **Data Expansion** – Incorporating a **larger and more diverse dataset** for improved accuracy  
- **Real-Time Analysis** – Developing an API for **live social media monitoring**  

---

## Applications  

- **Customer Feedback Analysis** – Analyzing reviews and sentiment trends  
- **Social Media Monitoring** – Tracking public opinion in real time  
- **Opinion Mining** – Extracting insights from multilingual discussions
